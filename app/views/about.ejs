			<p><span class="biko">Bitflop</span> was born out of the desire to play texas holdem online, but with the ability to see your opponenet in real time. The available options at the time were not very easy to use, and/or required installing software packages. <span class="biko">Bitflop</span> only requires a modern browser (see the <a href="/faq">FAQ's</a>) and a webcam to experience online poker the way it should be.</p>

			<p>We are using the latest HTML5 WebRTC technology to deliver peer-to-peer, encrypted, high definition audio/video in the web browser. No third-party app downloads or browser-plugins required! Simply login to your account and start playing poker.</p>
